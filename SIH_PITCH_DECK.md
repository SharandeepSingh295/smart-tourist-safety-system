## 🎯 **Presentation Tips for SIH**

### **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
> "Imagine you're a tourist in an unknown city. It's getting dark, you're lost, and you feel unsafe. Our system would have predicted this situation 10 minutes ago and guided you to safety. This is not imagination - this is our working Smart Tourist Safety System."

### **Demo Strategy**
1. **Open live website on projector**
2. **Show real-time location tracking**
3. **Demonstrate emergency alert**
4. **Display safety analytics**
5. **Highlight mobile responsiveness**

### **Key Talking Points**
